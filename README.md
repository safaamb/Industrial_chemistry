<p>The aim of this project is:</p>
<ul>
<li>obtain the VLE (Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium diagram) the given binary mixture at the given pressures ;</li>
<li> Calculate the temperatures, number of stages, distillate and residue flow rates for a distillation tower working under a specific pressure and feed conditions ;</li>
<li> Design heat exchanger using appropriate correlation and using a software (Aspen).</li>
</ul>
